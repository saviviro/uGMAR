# uGMAR 3.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* New exported functions: get_regime_means, get_regime_autocovs, get_regime_vars, uncondMoments, get_soc, condMoments, stmarpars_to_gstmar, stmar_to_gstmar.
* Implemented an algorithm by Monahan (1984) to the genetic algorithm for more thorough search of the parameter space near boundaries of the stationarity region.
* Generally more functionality for conditional and unconditional moments.
* simulateGSMAR now provides better tools for forecasting. This update includes mildly non-backward compatible changes for the return values if the argument ntimes is set to be larger than one: $sample of the returned list is now a column matrix not a vector, $component is also now a matrix, $mixingWeights is now mixing_weights and an array.
* The arguments nCalls and nCores in fitGSMAR are now changed to ncalls and ncores for consistency.
* Minor fixes on bugs that used to cause errors in some special cases.      
* Updates on documentation
* Added inflation expectation data (IE)
* Generally more functionality for conditional and unconditional moments, and convenient tools for switching to G-StMAR model from a StMAR model.
