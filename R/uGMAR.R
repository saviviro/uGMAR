#' @title uGMAR: Estimate Univariate Gaussian and Student's t Mixture Autoregressive Models
#'
#' @description \code{uGMAR} is a package for estimating univariate Gaussian Mixture Autoregressive (GMAR),
#'   Student's t Mixture Autoregressive (StMAR), and Gaussian and Student's t Mixture Autoregressive (G-StMAR) models.
#'   It provides tools for quantile residuals based model diagnostics, forecasting, and simulation, to name a few.
#'   Imposing linear constraints to the autoregressive parameters of each regime or restricting them to be the same
#'   for all regimes is supported.
#'
#'   Many of the functions documented are not exported but for intended internal use only. The readme file and the
#'   vignette are a good place to start.
