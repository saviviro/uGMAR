\value{
Returns an object of class \code{'gsmar'} defining the estimated GMAR, StMAR or G-StMAR model. The returned object contains
  estimated mixing weights, some conditional and unconditional moments, and quantile residuals. Note that the first \code{p}
  observations are taken as the initial values, so the mixing weights, conditional moments, and quantile residuals start from
  the \code{p+1}:th observation (interpreted as t=1). In addition, the returned object contains the estimates and log-likelihoods
  from all of the estimation rounds. See \code{?GSMAR} for the form of the parameter vector, if needed.
}
\description{
\code{fitGSMAR} estimates GMAR, StMAR, or G-StMAR model in two phases. In the first phase, a genetic algorithm is employed
  to find starting values for a gradient based method. In the second phase, the gradient based variable metric algorithm is utilized to
  accurately converge to a local maximum or a saddle point near each starting value. Parallel computing is used to conduct multiple
  rounds of estimations in parallel.
}
\details{
Because of complexity and multimodality of the log-likelihood function, it's \strong{not guaranteed} that the estimation
 algorithm will end up in the global maximum point. It's often expected that most of the estimation rounds will end up in
 some local maximum point instead, and therefore a number of estimation rounds is required for reliable results. Because
 of the nature of the models, the estimation may fail particularly in the cases where the number of mixture components is
 chosen too large. Note that the genetic algorithm is designed to avoid solutions with mixing weights of some regimes
 too close to zero at almost all times ("redundant regimes") but the settings can, however, be adjusted (see ?GAfit).

 If the iteration limit for the variable metric algorithm (\code{maxit}) is reached, one can continue the estimation by
 iterating more with the function \code{iterate_more}.

 The core of the genetic algorithm is mostly based on the description by \emph{Dorsey and Mayer (1995)}. It utilizes
 a slightly modified version the individually adaptive crossover and mutation rates described by \emph{Patnaik and Srinivas (1994)}
 and employs (50\%) fitness inheritance discussed by \emph{Smith, Dike and Stegmann (1995)}. Large (in absolute value) but stationary
 AR parameter values are generated with the algorithm proposed by Monahan (1984).

 The variable metric algorithm (or quasi-Newton method, Nash (1990, algorithm 21)) used in the second phase is implemented
 with function the \code{optim} from the package \code{stats}.

 \strong{Additional Notes about the estimates:}

 Sometimes the found MLE is very close to the boundary of the stationarity region some regime, the related variance parameter
 is very small, and the associated mixing weights are "spiky". This kind of estimates often maximize the log-likelihood function
 for a technical reason that induces by the endogenously determined mixing weights. In such cases, it might be more appropriate
 to consider the next-best local maximum point of the log-likelihood function that is well inside the parameter space. Models based
 local-only maximum points can be built with the function \code{alt_gsmar} by adjusting the argument \code{which_largest}
 accordingly.

 Some mixture components of the StMAR model may sometimes get very large estimates for the degrees of freedom parameters.
 Such parameters are weakly identified and induce various numerical problems. However, mixture components with large degree
 of freedom parameter estimates are similar to the mixture components of the GMAR model. It's hence advisable to further
 estimate a G-StMAR model by allowing the mixture components with large degrees of freedom parameter estimates to be GMAR
 type with the function \code{stmar_to_gstmar}.

 \strong{Filtering inappropriate estimates:} If \code{filter_estimates == TRUE}, the function will automatically filter
 out estimates that it deems "inappropriate". That is, estimates that are not likely solutions of interest.
 Specifically, it filters out solutions that incorporate regimes with any modulus of the roots of the AR polynomial less
 than \eqn{1.0015}; a variance parameter estimat near zero  (less than \eqn{0.0015});
 mixing weights such that they are close to zero for almost all \eqn{t} for at least one regime; or mixing weight parameter
 estimate close to zero (or one). You can also set \code{filter_estimates=FALSE} and find the solutions of interest yourself
 by using the function \code{alt_gsmar}.
