\title{uGMAR: Estimate Univariate Gaussian and Student's t Mixture Autoregressive Models}
\description{
\code{uGMAR} is a package for estimating univariate Gaussian Mixture Autoregressive (GMAR),
  Student's t Mixture Autoregressive (StMAR), and Gaussian and Student's t Mixture Autoregressive (G-StMAR) models.
  It provides tools for quantile residuals based model diagnostics, forecasting, and simulation, to name a few.
  Imposing linear constraints to the autoregressive parameters of each regime or restricting them to be the same
  for all regimes is supported.

  Many of the functions documented are not exported but for intended internal use only. The readme file and the
  vignette are a good place to start.
