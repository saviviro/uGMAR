\title{Calculate "distance" between two regimes}
\usage{
regime_distance(regime_pars1, regime_pars2)
}
\arguments{
\item{regime_pars1}{a numeric vector representing a regime.}

\item{regime_pars2}{a numeric vector representing another regime, same length as \code{regime_pars1}}
}
\value{
Returns "distance" between \code{regime_pars1} and \code{regime_pars2}. Values are scaled
  to the same magnitude before calculating the "distance". Read the source code for details.
}
\description{
\code{regime_distance} scales each regime parameter to the same magnitude
 and then calculates distance between scaled \code{regime_pars1} and \code{regime_pars2}.
